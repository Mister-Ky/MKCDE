# MKCDE (Modular Kit for Code Development Efficiency) - open source c++ library

 simplifies working with libraries such as:
 * SFML	(https://github.com/SFML/SFML/tree/2.6.x and https://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php)
 * ImGui-SFML (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui and https://github.com/SFML/imgui-sfml)


## It's still in beta, and I'm already working on updating it.
